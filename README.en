   === CResourceIntake ===
   =======================
A project whose purpose is to automate the inclusion of binary data from 
files (resources) into a program written in C++.

Data inclusion is realized by converting resource files into source code 
in C++, which will be further compiled into a library that can be linked 
to any program. Data obtained from resource files are available as 
global variables.

The project contains:

 - dir ./cri - main directory for generating the resource library. 
   To include resources in your program, just add the intake.py file, 
   which generates the library sources. For an example of how to run 
   this script correctly, see CMakeLists.txt. The resources.json file 
   should contain information about the resource files included 
   in the library.
   
 - dir–≥ ./example - directory with an example of linking and using 
   the resource library.
